#+TITLE: Notes on Chapter 22 of TAPL: Type Reconstruction

* Solutions

** Declarative System:

Given
- A Context $\Gamma$
- A Term $t$
- A Substitution $\sigma$
- A Type $T$

A solution for $(\Gamma, t)$ is a pair $(\sigma, T)$ such that
\[ \sigma(\Gamma) \vdash \sigma(t) : T \]

** Algorithmic System:

Given
- Context $\Gamma$
- Term $t$
- Type $S$ (with unification variable)
- Constraint set $C$
- Constraint typing relation $\Gamma \vdash t : S ~|~ C$

A solution for $(\Gamma, t, S, C)$ is a pair $(\sigma, T)$ such that
1. $\sigma$ satisfies $C$, and
2. $\sigma(S) = T$

** Additional Notes

- This formulation of the 
- Because of the definition of solution. In practice, we only need to find some substitution $\sigma$ that satisfies $C$. With $\sigma$, we can instantiate $T = \sigma(S)$ to satisfy the second condition
