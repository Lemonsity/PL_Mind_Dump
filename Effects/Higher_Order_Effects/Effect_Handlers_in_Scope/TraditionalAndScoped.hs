{- Intuition of [cut, call, go]
Consider if we bind [cut]  the program to a program
At this point our program ends with a branching of
     ...
    /   \
   ()  cutfail
If we bind this branching computation with more
computations, by the defintion of [Functor Nondet],
the further computation will be appended to [()] and [fail]

Now go back to consider the implementation of [go]
[go] in essense traverse a nondet computation tree
by doing a DFS

So once it hit fail, a bunch of the tree will no longer
be explored

[call] is just a wrapper for [go] that append a [fail] to
the DFS result -}

once :: (Nondet ⊂ sig) => Prog (Cut + sig) b -> Prog sig b
once p = call (do { x <- p
                  ; cut
                  ; return x })

{- Intuitition of [once]
We expand the [do] syntax, and the [cut] content

We recall [>>=] for Nondet append computation to the end
Thus we see each [Return] leaf in the computation tree
go through the following transformation:

     ...                 ...
      |                   |
   Return x           Op Branch

                       ()   Cutfail'
                      /
                  Return x

Relate back to [call / go] DFS traverse the computation
tree, we can see what it means by committing to one branch

once' p = call (p >>=
                \x -> (skip `branching` cutfail) >>=
                \_ -> return x)

{- Thoughts

I also think this functionality is only achieved by using
the laziness of Haskell

Otherwise, any finite computation tree with at least one
[Cutfail'] in it will be pruned away entirely

What we hope is the [solutions] collect some soluitons
before it gets to the branch that have a [Cutfail']

{- The Motive Behind Problematic Code

a term with no operator -}

{- Issues
Consider running [call] on [exprBad]

This causes issue when the term to parse is just a number -}

badParsingAlt = (allsols . parse "1+10") exprBadRev

{- Non-solution
We could consider going to the extreme, where we do not use
the [call] handler within [expr]. Instead, we put [call]
outside of [parse]

However, that would make the [call] handler handler a larger
scope, which is not what we want -}

{--------------------------------------------------------
Scoping Handler

Borrowing notations from papers on Eff,
the type of handler [call] is roughly the following:

A ! { Cut, Nondet, e } => A ! { Nondet, e }

With traditional effect handler, whatever program the
handler [call] is applied to is the scope of the handler

Another property with traditional handler is that if the
handler encounters an operation it cannot handled, the
handler is pushed into the continuation.
This "pushing in" process effectively changes the scope
of the handler.

The issue we ran into is that when [go] in [call]
encounters the following:

go (do symbol '+' ; p1) (go p2 fail)

It sees the operation [symbol], doesn't know how to handle
it, so forward it outside:

do symbol '+' ; (go p1 (go p2 fail))

Binding this program to the end of [i <- term] gives the
semantic of:

"Every term should be followed by a symbol '+'"

Which is incorrect
--------------------------------------------------------}

{--------------------------------------------------------
What is the Problem

Intuitively, the semantic we are trying to achieve is the
following:

- Try to parse a '+'
- If failed, backtrack to before parsing '+', and try the
  alternative

The problem with traditional handler is when a handler is:
1. Top level operation dictate the whether a handler is
   pushed in
2. There is no mechanism for a handler to be "pulled back
   out"

{- Intuition of Definitions

There is only one order of the handlers that make sense:
  Run [Symbol] before [Call]
Switching the order will always result in the [symbol '+']
operation escaping [Call] and lead to undesired behaviour

Thus, the remaining goal is to ensure [call] only does
pruning within a scope

[call']:
  Wraps a computation in a scope, with explicit operations
  acting as delimiters

I believe the key design is demonstrated here:
  [ecall (ECall p) = return p]
The part of the computation after the scope delimitation
is treated as a single opaque computation. Thus [call]
cannot prune away the internal structure.

If no internal structure can be observed, there is no way
to prune too much -}

{- Ordering of Handlers

The paper mentions
> The [catch] embedded within [tripleDecr] cannot be
> exchanged with [runState], because it would change
> the scope created by [catch]

I think there are two ways to exchange the orders,
and I think both indeed lead to unintented meaning

1. Keep [catch] where it is, push [runState] inside [catch]
  This is incorrect, because it forces the two inner [decr]s
  to operate on a separate state. In reality, we want the
  three [decr]s to operate on the same state

2. Keep [runState] where it is, pull [catch] to outside
   of [runState]
  This is also incorrect. We want [tripleDecr] to have
  the following behaviour:
  - The first [decr] may error, in which case the error is
    not recoverable
  - The second and third [decr] may error, but are recoverable
    through [catch]
  If we pull [catch] out, then suddenly all [decr] are
  recoverable
-}

{- Example of Reordering Handlers

Recall we don't want the first [decr] be recoverable
So we should expect the following code to just give us [Left]
(Because the first [decr] will immediately try to decrement 0)

However, running it will give us [Right (-10, ())] -}
