* About this Directory

Here you can find the code for "Effect Handlers in Scope" [cite:@wu_effect_2014] by Nicolas Wu, Tom Schrijvers and Ralf Hinze

The code is written in GHC 9.10.1

* Code Structure

Code is currently contained in two files:
- ~TraditionalAndScoped.hs~ :: Mostly cover Section 1-9. Mainly on traditional and scoped effects
- ~HigherOrderSyntax.hs~ :: Mostly cover Section 10-11. Mainly on higher-order effects

* Self-indulgence

I added some notes to the code to help me understand the implementation better

I also added some extra examples to illustrate (what I thought are) subtle nuances

I also cleaned up some code, adding brackets and type annotations as needed to make sure code executes

* TODO WIP

- [ ] Finish Section 9 & 11
- [ ] Add dedicated note file

* Bibliography
