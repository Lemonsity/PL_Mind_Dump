#+TITLE: Some Restrictions in Higher-Kinded Systems

#+BIBLIOGRAPHY: "../References/PL/Textbooks/Ref.bib"

This note came to be after noticing some details when reading Chapter 30, Higher-Order Polymorphism of TAPL [cite:@10.5555/509043]. 

* Background

One of the kinding rule for $F_\omega$ is as follow:

\[\frac
{\Gamma , X :: K_1 \vdash T_2 :: \star}
{\Gamma \vdash \forall X :: K_1 ~.~ T_2 :: \star}
\]

Consider the highlighted part. The question we pose is:

#+begin_center
In the presumption, why does $T_2$ need to have the kind \star?
#+end_center

* Intuition

Intuitively, the kind "\star" are:

#+begin_center
Types that can be inhabited with actual value.
#+end_center

We illustrate this idea with some examples:
- The type ~Int~ has kind "\star", and we can construct values such as ~10 : Int~
- The type ~Maybe Char~ has kind "\star", and we can construct values such as ~Just 'A' : Maybe Char~
- The type ~Maybe~ has kind "\star \to \star", and there is no value with the type just ~Maybe~
