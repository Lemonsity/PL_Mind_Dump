* Haskell Desugaring

As stated in the [[https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/debugging.html#ghc-flag-ddump-ds][documentation]], GHC comes with the options:
- ~-ddump-ds~
- ~-ddump-ds-preopt~
Both dumps the desugared code

Here we compiled ~What_is_Fmap.hs~ with the option, and example the code to verify typeclass gets elaborated to record and projects
