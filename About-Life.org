* How One /May/ Start doing research? (Thank you SPJ and Michael D. Adams)
- Try some practical programming
  - Research problem may come out of it
    - From SPJ: Of time when implementing, research problems arise. A programmer can choose to hask it away, or attempt to find a proper solution
  - Even if it is not research, it can help gain experiences in a particular field
  - You can discover ergonomic problems just from programming a lot, for example
    - Runtime information to help with performance debugging
    - Better navigation of massive library with large numbers of API
- One can still do theoretical research
  - But one may not find use for it
- It may be valuable to open up / explore the middle ground between purely theoretical and practical
  - Of course this won't be easy either, but it is an area to consider
