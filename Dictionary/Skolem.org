#+TITLE: Skolem

A /Skolem/ variable is a variable created during unification that can only equal to itself.

* Example

When considering types like $(\forall \beta . \beta \to \beta)$, we can remove the "\forall" by turning the "\beta" into a Skolem. This process turns the type into $(\beta \to \beta)$.

After the transformation, the meta-variable \beta now takes on new property, that it cannot be assigned to any value other than itself. So from this point on, the following assignments are *INVALID*:
- \beta := Int (Skolem cannot be assigned to monomorphic types)
- \beta := \alpha (Skolem cannot be assigned to other type variables)

However, Skolem can be used as solutions to other assignments:
- \alpha := \beta

Skolem also enjoys reflexivity property: \beta = \beta
