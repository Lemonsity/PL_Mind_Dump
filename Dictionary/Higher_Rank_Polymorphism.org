/let-polymorphism/ or /Prenex Polymorphism/ is a subset of [[./Predicative_Polymorphism.org][predicative polymorphism]].
- Variables can only be instantiated with monomorphic types
- All quantifier cannot appear to the left of the arrow (contravariant position)

/Rank-2 Polymorphism/ is a kind of polymorphism where

#+begin_quote
A type is said to be of rank 2 if no path from its root to a \forall quantifier passes to the left of 2 or more arrows, when the type is drawn as a tree.
