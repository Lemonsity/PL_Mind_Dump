/Predicative Polymorphism/ or /Stratified/ is a form of polymorphism where quantifiers can only be instantiated with monomorphic types. [cite:@10.1145/2544174.2500582]

/Impredicative Polymorphism/ is defined differently. From TAPL [cite:@10.5555/509043], it is as follow:

#+begin_quote
In general, a deﬁnition (of a set, a type, etc.) is called “impredicative” if it involves a quantifier whose domain includes the very thing being defined.

For example, in System F, the type variable X in the type (T = \forall X . X \to X) ranges over all types, including T itself
